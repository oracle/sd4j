# SD4J (Stable Diffusion in Java)

This repo contains an implementation of Stable Diffusion inference running on top of ONNX Runtime,
written in Java. It's a modified port of the [C# implementation](https://github.com/cassiebreviu/StableDiffusion/),
with a GUI for repeated generations and support for negative text inputs. It is intended to be a
demonstration of how to use ONNX Runtime from Java, and best practices for ONNX Runtime to get good performance.
We will keep it current with the latest releases of ONNX Runtime, with appropriate updates as new performance
related ONNX Runtime features become available through the ONNX Runtime Java API. All the code is subject to change as
this is a code sample, any APIs in it should not be considered stable.

This repo targets ONNX Runtime 1.14. The version number is in two parts `<sd4j-version>-<onnxruntime-version>`, and the
initial release of sd4j is v1.0-1.14.0. We'll bump the sd4j version number if it gains new features and the ONNX Runtime
version number as we depend on newer versions of ONNX Runtime.

The project supports txt2img generation, it doesn't currently implement img2img, upscaling or inpainting.

By default it uses a fp32 model, and running on a 6 core 2019 16" Intel Macbook Pro each diffusion step takes around 5s. 
Running on better hardware, enabling the CoreML EP, or with a CUDA GPU will greatly reduce the time taken to generate an
image. 

## Example images

These are a few example images generated by this code along with their generation parameters:

![Generated image from the prompt "Wildlife photograph of an astronaut riding a horse in the desert"](images/astronaut-horse.png "Wildlife photograph of an astronaut riding a horse in the desert")

Text: "Wildlife photograph of an astronaut riding a horse in the desert", Negative Text: "", Seed: 42, Guidance Scale: 10, Inference Steps: 40, Scheduler: Euler Ancestral, Image Size: 512x512.

![Generated image from the prompt "Press photo of an America's Cup catamaran sailing through the sands of Mars, high resolution, high quality"](images/boat-mars.png "Press photo of an America's Cup catamaran sailing through the sands of Mars")

Text: "Press photo of an America's Cup catamaran sailing through the sands of Mars, high resolution, high quality", Negative Text: "water, sea, ocean, lake", Seed: 42, Guidance Scale: 10, Inference Steps: 40, Scheduler: Euler Ancestral, Image Size: 512x512.

![Generated image from the prompt "Professional photograph of the Apollo 11 lunar lander in a field, high quality, 4k"](images/lunar-lander.png "Professional photograph of the Apollo 11 lunar lander in a field, high quality, 4k")

Text: "Professional photograph of the Apollo 11 lunar lander in a field, high quality, 4k", Negative Text: "", Seed: 42, Guidance Scale: 10, Inference Steps: 50, Scheduler: Euler Ancestral, Image Size: 512x512.

![Generated image from the prompt "Professional photograph of George Washington in his garden grilling steaks, detailed face, high quality, 4k"](images/washington-steak.png "Professional photograph of George Washington in his garden grilling steaks, detailed face, high quality, 4k")

Text: "Professional photograph of George Washington in his garden grilling steaks, detailed face, high quality, 4k", Negative Text: "painting, drawing, art", Seed: 42, Guidance Scale: 10, Inference Steps: 60, Scheduler: Euler Ancestral, Image Size: 512x512.

## Installation

This project requires [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org), [Java 17 or newer](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/),
a compiled ONNX Runtime extensions binary, and a Stable Diffusion model checkpoint.
The other dependencies (ONNX Runtime and Apache Commons Math) are downloaded by Maven automatically.

### Prepare model checkpoint

There are many compatible models on [Hugging Face's website](https://huggingface.co). We have tested the
Stable Diffusion v1.5 checkpoint, which has pre-built ONNX models. This can be downloaded via 
the following `git` commands (skip the first one if you have already configured `git-lfs`):
```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 -b onnx
```
The Stable Diffusion v1.5 checkpoint is available under the [OpenRAIL-M license](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion/blob/main/LICENSE).
For other models there is a one or two stage process to generate the ONNX format models. If the model is already in 
Hugging Face Diffusers format then you can run the `convert_stable_diffusion_checkpoint_to_onnx.py` file from the 
[diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) project as follows:
```bash
python scripts/convert_stable_diffusion_checkpoint_to_onnx.py --model_path <path-on-disk-or-model-hub-name> --output_path <path-to-onnx-model-folder>
```
If the model is an original stable diffusion checkpoint then you first need to run:
```bash
python scripts/convert_original_stable_diffusion_to_diffusers.py --checkpoint_path <path-on-disk-to-checkpoint> --scheduler_type lms --dump_path <path-on-disk-to-diffusers-output>
```
Both scripts require a suitable Python 3 virtual environment with diffusers and onnx installed.

### Setup ORT extensions
You will also need to check out and compile onnxruntime-extensions for your platform. The repo is [https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-extensions](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-extensions),
and it can be compiled with `./build_lib.sh --config Release --update --build --parallel` which generates the required library (`libortextensions.[dylib,so]` or `ortextensions.dll`) in the
`build/<OS-name>/Release/lib/` folder. That library should be copied into the root of this directory.

## Running the GUI

The GUI can be executed with `mvn package exec:exec -DmodelPath=<path-to-stable-diffusion-model>`. It constructs a
window where you can specify the parameters of the image you'd like to generate, and each image creates its own window
where it can save the image as a png file.

### Use in other programs

The `com.oracle.labs.mlrg.sd4j.SD4J` class provides a full image generation pipeline which can be used without the GUI
directly from other code.

### Using a CUDA GPU

To use the GPU you need to modify the pom file to depend on `onnxruntime_gpu` and swap `<argument>CPU</argument>` for
`<argument>CUDA</argument>` in the `exec-maven-plugin` block.

## Implementation details

This code provides a thin `Tensor` wrapper object which is a tuple of a direct `ByteBuffer` instance and a long shape
array, which is used to provide easy access in and out of ORT's `OnnxTensor` objects. There's a `Scheduler` interface 
which the two available schedulers (LMS and Euler Ancestral) implement. The `SD4J` pipeline object is a suitable entry
point for use without the GUI, and there is an example of such usage in the `CLIApp` class.
